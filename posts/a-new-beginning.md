🙌, My name is Thomas Nguyen. I’m a software developer based in the Bay Area.

Every year, I aspire to write out my thoughts in a blog **but** every-time the results are the same. I spend a great 1-2 weeks building the blogging platform and then by the end of January, I drop the writing. The blogging project is abandoned

The truth is, blogging is _hard, very hard_. Expressing technical thoughts is one of the most difficult skills to master as an engineer. On top of that, writing takes time, **a lot** of time.

With that being said, I want to attempt this endeavor again. But this time, aiming at a different angle and with a new sense of discipline.

## 💪 This year will be different

The hardest part of starting any habit is getting started. Looking back at the years, there was simply too much friction with starting a blog post. This includes the writing process as well as putting it together visually.

Now as a more capable engineer, I’m able to automate tasks that would normally have taken me hours.

Additionally, I’m going to spend less time on technical writing. My interests goes beyond coding and I have desires to write about them.

Such as Bumi, [my puppy Corgi.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14298038/103112874-d5799900-460c-11eb-9f5f-7a030244069f.jpg) ♥️

## Enjoy

I hope you guys enjoy reading these writing as much as it does for me to create them. 2021 will be a great year I promise.
